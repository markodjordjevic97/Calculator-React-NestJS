Must have. 

**1-Must use React hooks and TypeScript.**. 

**2-Everything should be typed from A to Z. No use of any, unknown, object and other similar types, where they can be known.**. 

**3-Must have unit tests, that cover all major edge cases for calculator**. 

**4-Must be fully handling all special cases of calculator, like: division by zero, trying to do a math**. 

**5-expression from unfinished float number e.g., “233.” etc.**. 

**6-All calculation process must be done in back-end.**. 

**7-Can't use libraries that do "safe evaluation" for you, like expr-eval or other.**. 

**8-Calls to the BE must be secure.**. 

**9-Must be able to handle the following math operators:  %, /, *, -, +, +/-.**. 

**10-Good coding practices and clean code.**. 

**11-Should look like IOS calculator(image bellow)**. 

Nice to have. 

**1-Should look like iOS calculator**. 

**2-Front-end is fully responsive on all resolution sizes from iPhone 5 to 4K**. 

3-Use State manager (MobX) and Styled Components.  

**4-Use in a Mono repo**. 

**5-Calculator layout easily changeable. Easy, means we wouldn't need to change much code to change the layout of calculator.**. 

6-Custom webpack config's instead of using react-scripts boilerplate.
